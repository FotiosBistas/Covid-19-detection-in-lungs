# A CNN to detect covid in lungs

This is a small personal project that uses two datasets to evaluate a CNN's ability to classify between lungs infected with covid and those that are healthy. The CNN is completely self made and is not going to use an existing/external architecture. 

The two datasets used are a collection of CT scans.
